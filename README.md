# OCR using OpenCV and Encog

## This project was an experimental / crash course on OCR. Primarily to explore Neural Networks and touch a little on Computer vision basics. The outcome, has developed into a full user interface using Swing :/ and JTattoo look and feel theme. Below is the GUI design and a few functionalities the program is capable of. 

Dependencies:

•	OpenCV v3.2.0 - Java bindings

•	Encog-core v3.3.0 - (Machine Learning API – A fantastic library)

•	JTattoo v1.6.11 (Look and feel theme – the short cut to trying to make it look pretty)

•	JFreeCharts v1.0.19

## Imaging Functions

#### Used OpenCV for most imaging manipulation methods.At the moment the only imaging funtions that can manually be used to alter images are:  
  > Contrast 
  
    Using Histogram Equalization
    Contrast sketching
